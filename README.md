# GLogic
Logic gate(s) operations simulator with my own simple Entity Component System implementation, mainly paying attention to storing data in Data Oriented Entity System with weakly references

To run this application, download the following dlls: SDL2, SDL2_image, SDL2_ttf, SDL2-CS, SDL2_gfx, and Oswald-Light.ttf font.
Then copy them to the folder with the startup file. If you use dotnet build, It will be in GLogic/bin/Debug&Release/net{version}
